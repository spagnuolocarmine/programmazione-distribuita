## \#1Ô∏è‚É£ The Shell

### What is the shell?

Computers these days have a variety of interfaces for giving them commands; fanciful graphical user interfaces, voice interfaces, and even AR/VR are everywhere. These are great for 80% of use-cases, but they are often fundamentally restricted in what they allow you to do ‚Äî you cannot press a button that isn‚Äôt there or give a voice command that hasn‚Äôt been programmed. To take full advantage of the tools your computer provides, we have to go old-school and drop down to a textual interface: The Shell.

Nearly all platforms you can get your hand on has a shell in one form or another, and many of them have several shells for you to choose from. While they may vary in the details, at their core they are all roughly the same: they allow you to run programs, give them input, and inspect their output in a semi-structured way.

In this lecture, we will focus on the Bourne Again SHell, or ‚Äúbash‚Äù for short. This is one of the most widely used shells, and its syntax is similar to what you will see in many other shells. To open a shell prompt (where you can type commands), you first need a terminal. Your device probably shipped with one installed, or you can install one fairly easily.

## \#2Ô∏è‚É£ Finding files and regular expressions

**_Avoid repetitive tasks or use tools to help in such tasks!_** 

For instance, it is vital to use tools for finding files or search content in file.

### ```find```
All UNIX-like systems provide a package named find, a tool to find files, and it will recursively search for files matching specific criteria.

```bash
# Find all directories named src
find . -name src -type d
# Find all python files that have a folder named test in their path
find . -path '*/test/*.py' -type f
# Find all files modified in the last day
find . -mtime -1
# Find all zip files with size in range 500k to 10M
find . -size +500k -size -10M -name '*.tar.gz'
# Delete all files with .tmp extension
find . -name '*.tmp' -exec rm {} \;
# Find all PNG files and convert them to JPG
find . -name '*.png' -exec convert {} {}.jpg \;
```

### ```fd```
It is an alternative to the find command and promises to offer better and more comprehensive outputs.

**Install:** ```brew install fd``` or see [Github](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) page also for documentation.

### ```grep```
The find command permits you to search files using names or matching patterns, while the grep command allows you to find inside the content of your files, such as searching specific lines of codes and more.

```bash
# Search all file that contains the string hello of types txt and doc
grep -r --include=\*.{txt,doc} "hello" .
# Ignore case
grep -i "this" test-file
# Count the number of patterns
ps -ef | grep -c $USER
# Display line numbers of a match
grep -n "set" ~/.zshrc
```

It is also helpful in finding your command history ```history | grep find```.

### Regular Expressions
//TODO description of regular expression and different flavors

Basic patterns:

- `.` means ‚Äúany single character‚Äù except newline
- `*` zero or more of the preceding match
- `+` one or more of the preceding match
- `[abc]` any one character of a, b, and c
- `(Hello|Ciao)` either something that matches Hello or Ciao
- `^` the start of the line
- `$` the end of the line
